# The goal of this test is to check the behaviour of the program
# when a failure takes place while trying to write the PNG.
# To do so:
# File: image_writer.c
# Function: enum status write_image(struct canvas *ptr_c, char *file_path, char *file_name) (...)
# Line: 78 and 79
# Description: set result variable to '1' (a value different from zero)
