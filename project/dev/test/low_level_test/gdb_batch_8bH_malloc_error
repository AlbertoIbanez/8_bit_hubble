# The goal of this test is to check the behaviour of the program
# when there is no enough memory to initialize the canvas
# To do so:
# File: galaxy_generator.c
# Function: enum status generate_galaxy(struct canvas *gc) (...)
# Line: 141
# Description: set the local pointer to 0, reproducing a lack of memory
