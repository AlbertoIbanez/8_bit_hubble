# The goal of this test is to check the behaviour of the program
# when there is no enough memory for the PNG writting structure.
# To do so:
# File: image_writer.c
# Function: int write_png(char* filename, int width, int height, int *buffer) (...)
# Line: 107 and 108
# Description: set pointer to 0, to reproduce a failed opening operation
